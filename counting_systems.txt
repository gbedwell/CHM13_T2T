1-based coordinate system: A coordinate system where the first base of a sequence is one. In this co-
ordinate system, a region is specified by a closed interval. For example, the region between the 3rd
and the 7th bases inclusive is [3, 7]. The SAM, VCF, GFF and Wiggle formats are using the 1-based
coordinate system.

0-based coordinate: system A coordinate system where the first base of a sequence is zero. In this
coordinate system, a region is specified by a half-closed-half-open interval. For example, the region
between the 3rd and the 7th bases inclusive is [2, 7). The BAM, BCFv2, BED, and PSL formats are
using the 0-based coordinate system.

Phred scale: Given a probability 0 < p ≤1, the phred scale of p equals −10 log10 p, rounded to the closest
integer.
